        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
          I have been developing code since I was a sophomore in high school.
          Ever since my friend convinced me to install ubuntu and learn C with
          him. After that one weekend I decided that is what I wanted to do for
          a living. Ever since then I have been trying to learn and acquire as
          many possible skills to help me develop this passion. I will be using
          this site to showcase some of those skills and passions that I have
          picked up over the years.

          <h3>Design and Developing</h3>
          <p>
            One of the more recent skills that I have been working on is my
            ability to Design and Develop FullStack Web Applications. My big
            projects are currently this website as well as a private side
            project where I am developing a Group Playlist for Spotify.

          <h3>Advanced Python Programming</h3>
          <p>
            On top of my recent work as a designer I have been practicing my
            python programming over the last 4 years. I have done this with
            various different methods including: personal projects,LeetCode
            challenges, Google Codejam challenges, as well as working on various
            hackathons like Hack Dallas.
