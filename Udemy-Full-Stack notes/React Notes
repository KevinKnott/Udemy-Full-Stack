In order to use React we will start by using codesandbox.io

To begin we need to:
Import React from "React";
Import ReactDOM from "React-dom";

This allows us to use React.

Once that is done we can use ReactDom to help re render HTML:

//Create a react app from scratch.

ReactDOM takes two things:
    1. What to place
    2. Where to place it

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>My Favourite Foods</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Steak</li>
      <li>Nachos</li>
      <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
//It should display a h1 heading.
//It should display an unordered list (bullet points).
//It should contain 3 list elements.
